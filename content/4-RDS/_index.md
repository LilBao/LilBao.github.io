## Introduce RDS Service

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud. Choose from eight popular engines: Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition, Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition, RDS for PostgreSQL, RDS for MySQL, RDS for MariaDB, RDS for SQL Server, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for Db2. Deploy on premises with Amazon RDS on AWS Outposts or with elevated access to the underlying operating system and database environment using Amazon RDS Custom.
